This Project is about training a AI model using transfer learning by taking a pretrained resnet50 model where byteplot images of pe files are fed to the model. the data is collected from various kaggle repos and fed to BPI python code which converts pe's to binary images. the images are splitted into 3 types namely train test and validate which is fed to pre trained resnet50 model. the images are trained into the model and tested along by using confusion matrix. as of now due to limited test samples the accuracy achieved is 98.19%
